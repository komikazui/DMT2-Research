# DMT2 Research
Contains (probably) useful information about the arcade version of DJMAX TECHNIKA 2.
# Information of various directories from .pak files
As of writing this readme, there are no (public) tools to extract the contents of Technika 2 International. I have recently discovered metadata from the pak files referencing various Adobe products. They also do not have obfuscation unlike the future title, TECHNIKA 3. Also, the directories of the pak contents are listed under "Client.exe". The game will read from the pak files first. Same goes for Technika 3. Removing the pak will make the game read DIRECTLY from the directory that this specific file is stored in. Keep that in mind. Also, every pak file except for the ones listed in the "pt" folder will have it's contents stored in "Resource/"[name of pak file goes here]".

# How to extract assets from pak file?
The paks have compression in them, so the output of image files will be poor quality. You can use bruteforcing methods to extract.

# Important information
TECHNIKA and the DJMAX series are properties of Neowiz/Pentavision, all things shown here belong to them only. I will not provide any files from their game, only research for people who are interested in modding the game.
